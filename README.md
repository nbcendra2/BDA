# Bayesian Data Analysis Coursework

This repository contains coursework projects completed for the Bayesian Data Analysis module at the University of Edinburgh. The projects apply Bayesian modeling techniques to real-world datasets across environmental, biological, and spatial domains.

## Coursework 1: Rainfall & Frog Call Modeling

- **Rainfall in Edinburgh**: Fitted a Bayesian linear regression model using INLA to predict monthly rainfall based on temperature and windspeed.  
- **Frog Call Clustering**: Applied Bayesian mixture models to Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) from frog call audio to classify species based on acoustic features.

## Coursework 2: Caterpillar Insecticide Study

- Modeled the effect of different insecticide treatments on caterpillar birth rates using Bayesian regression techniques to estimate treatment impact and uncertainty.

- Developed a Bayesian spatio-temporal model using INLA and inlabru to analyze ground-level ozone concentrations across England and Wales, incorporating spatial structure (via SPDE) and year effects for public health insight.
